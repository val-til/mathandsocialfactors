Balancing Social Variables: The Impact of Social Factors on Math Performance

This study investigates the association between social factors and mathematics performance among high school students. Using data collected from Portuguese high schools, we analyzed the impact of variables such as social outing frequency, romantic relationships, extracurricular involvement, and parental education on final math grades. Employing statistical techniques such as Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and multiple linear regression, we explored relationships and validated assumptions about the data's distribution and linearity. Individual social variables showed limited explanatory power in predicting final grades. Rather, it was the combined effect of these variables that yielded significant results. Our findings emphasize the nuanced role of social and demographic factors in academic achievement.
